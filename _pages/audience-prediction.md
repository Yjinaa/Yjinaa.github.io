### Audience Prediction Project Using Big Data Analysis

*I-GPS Practical Problem Research Group*

*March 1, 2019 - November 22, 2019*

**Project Summary:**
Conducted a project focused on predicting audience numbers based on movie reviews. My role was to develop a crawler that gathered reviews for films with over 100,000 viewers from 2015 to 2019, providing the data in an analyzable format.

1. **Web Scraping:** Implemented a web crawler to collect and preprocess movie reviews data.
2. **Data Preparation:** Converted raw review data into a structured dataset suitable for analysis.

This project enabled the analysis of factors influencing audience numbers based on historical review data.
