## Welcome!
Hi, I'm Yeajin Byun. I'm passionate about helping people fully realize their potential in the metaverse. I'm particulary interested in **Music Information Retrieval** and **Music Generation**, with the goal of enabling everyone to express their musical creativity, regardless of their background knowledge. 

### My Passions

- 🎤 **Singing**: I love expressing myself through song.
- 🎹 **Playing the Piano**: There's nothing quite like the feel of keys under my fingers.
- 🍷 **Enjoying Wine**: I appreciate a good glass of wine.😌

### Why I Do What I Do
My dream is to create environments where creativity flourishes, especially in the metaverse. By combining technology with music, I believe we can unlock incredible new experiences and possibilities.
